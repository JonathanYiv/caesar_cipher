# Caesar Cipher Project

This is my version of implementing a [caesar cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher) in ruby.

This is a project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/building-blocks).

## Installation

Open your Terminal/Command Line. Navigate to the directory where your version will live. Type in the following:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/JonathanYiv/caesar_cipher.git
$ cd caesar_cipher
$ ruby lib/caesar_cipher.rb
```

## Pre-Project Thoughts

This should be easy.

## Post-Project Thoughts

1. It was easy.

2. In this [Odin follow-up project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/testing-ruby): 

	1. I came back to Caesar Cipher and integrated specifications using RSpec. I found ten possible scenarios to test, and added functionality for negative shift when I added the test. 

	2. I set up a RakeFile so I can use the '$ rake' command to run rspec based on the [documentation here](https://relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-core/docs/command-line/rake-task#passing-arguments-to-the-`rspec`-command-using-`rspec-opts`).
