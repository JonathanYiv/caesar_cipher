# Caesar Cipher Project

This is my version of implementing a [caesar cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher) in ruby.

This is a project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/building-blocks).

$ cd caesar_cipher
$ ruby cc.rb
```

## Pre-Project Thoughts

This should be easy.

## Post-Project Thoughts

It was easy.
